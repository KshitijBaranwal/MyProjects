Daily and Sports activity recognition, April 2020
Created a neural network model by starting with data cleaning, normalizing the range, using Principal
component analysis for reducing the high dimensional features, build 2-layer and 3-layer regularization model
compared the accuracy and selected the best model to predict which exercises were useful for which body parts.
Tools: R studio


Multiple Linear Regression in R, November 2019
Fitted MLR model to a good fit by examining various summary statistics. Performed exploratory data analysis,
hypothesis testing, and carried out diagnostics on the fitted model.
Tools: R studio


K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on the TunedIT data, November 2019
Performed KNN on the dataset by splitting the dataset into training and test set using PANDA and NUMPY
and determined the miss classification rate and predicted how the test data performs.
Tools: Python with PANDA and NUMPY Libraries


Google apps download prediction, November 2019
Implemented Multiple Linear Regression using Wolfram Mathematica on Google Play Store data and analyzed
how apps are downloaded based on user reviews, app category, and ratings.
Tools: Wolfram Mathematica
